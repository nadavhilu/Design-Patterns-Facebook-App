# Design-Patterns-Facebook-App
Facebook Windows application allowing the user to view their and their friends favorite pages and favorite youtube videos.
The app features implementation of different Design Patterns chosen to fit the project needs.


Notes:
- This is a students project, therefore it never went live and any feature that require access to facebook friends list is limited.
- This project was developed before the Facebook users information scandal of 2018, therefore some features may not function due to changes in Facebook API.
- The remote server for the database feature is down.
